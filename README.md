# Digital-Circuit-using-VHDL
I implemented a JK flip-flop using a 4:1 multiplexer and logic gates in VHDL. I received a state transition diagram for the automaton, as well as a table showing how the flip-flop operates on a rising clock edge. Also, for the multiplexer I used the sequential instruction IF...ELSE.
